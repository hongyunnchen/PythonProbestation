# PythonProbestation
A python GUI Program for controlling a pulsed probestation setup at Stanford University for my postdoc

Installation
============

PyView uses wxPython as it's backend. While you can install it manually, it is easiest to install
with conda (anaconda package manager). I recommend getting anaconda from [here](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), and then installing wxpython.

```
	conda update conda
	conda install wxpython
```

## Dependencies
* numpy
* wxPython
* PyVisa
